# ES6 & Beyond

## Chapter 1 - ES? Now & Future

* ES5 is the "current" version in all major browsers (specially IE).
* ES6, now ES2015, is the newer spec.
* Because the support for ES6 is spotty in some browsers (cough, cough), we have to depend on transpilers
	* Basically *translate* from ES6 to ES5 in a new tooling step.
* But we can use polyfills/shims, basically added features (like new functions in ES6) that don't require syntactic changes and can added in older JS versions.
